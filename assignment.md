# Managing Software Development Course Paper
## Context
All software projects will deal with people, processes and technology, from the developer view, and resources, time, scope and quality from the client view.  The industry as a whole is very volatile with continuing changes in technology.  Developers are continually searching for better practices to reduce costs while improving their ability to deliver a “quality” product on time that provides value to the customer.  Accordingly developers need to be able to apply past “best practices” of development, through analysis and synthesis of these, that are tailored for their current projects. 

## Learning objectives
To develop a strong understanding of a single aspect of software engineering project management to complement other coursework. 
1.	Develop research and problem-solving skills. 
2.	To conduct literature research in the area of Software Engineering 
3.	Practice ability to succinctly present written results to a managerial audience. 
4.	To synthesize Software Engineering lessons learned, best practices into a usable model for future development. 

## Assignment
Select a topic of interest to you that is related to material covered in this course, ie People, Teams, Processes, Scope, Planning and Controlling.  Research and write a report that is designed to be read by someone (imagine a past or future boss, colleague, future MSD student) with an interest in, but no knowledge of, the topic you are addressing.  The report should cover what is currently known/believed about this topic, and should especially focus on how to practically use this information.  

* *Nice* papers that are effectively just “reading reports”
* __Good__ papers show a synthesis of material in how it would be applied to improve a software development effort.
* **Best** papers present original and insightful thoughts that resonate with readers (such as instructors and TAs)

### More
* The report should begin with an abstract, which is an executive summary.
* Papers should be about 5000-6000 words, not including reference section
* Use IEEE format for the references. See the [guide](https://www.bath.ac.uk/publications/library-guides-to-citing-referencing/attachments/ieee-style-guide.pdf)
* The bibliography should have 5-10 academic sources. Prefer IEEE, ACM, Springer papers.
* Great to have 1-3 of [primary sources](https://umb.libguides.com/PrimarySources/secondary) (original research)
* Web pages typically are not very good sources and will not be counted in the grade for bibiliographie
* Cite all sources used and relate to the topic you discuss in the paper. _You should have learned hard about that so far._
* Plagiarism is not acceptable, we will check
* The AI-usage self-declaration is mandatory for all papers past 2022 see the [Template](./template.md)  

## Grading. Total 10 points

* (2) - original **topic** that points to a synthesis and analysis of specific area
* (2) - **bibliography** - 5 or more high quality academic sources
* (2) - **readability**, clearness, structure, coherence
* (4) - **content**. See above on *Nice*, __Good__ and **Best** papers.

Papers above 7 points grade are to be published.

# Hints and tips

## Selecting a topic

* Pick a topic that you like linked to MSD areas - people and teams, processes, scope, planning and controlling
* Chances are your topic is very broad or too narrow
* Check [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) for relevant papers
* Ensure you have enough material to cover your topic
* Adjust the topic to focus on a specific subject
