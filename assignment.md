## Context 🔍

Software projects are multifaceted, involving people, processes, and technology from the developer's perspective, as well as managing resources, time, scope, and quality from the client's view. The software industry is inherently dynamic, with continual advancements in technology. Developers are tasked with finding effective practices to reduce costs while delivering high-quality, timely products that provide customer value. To succeed, developers must learn to apply and adapt past "best practices" through analysis and synthesis tailored to current project needs.

## Learning Objectives 🎯

This assignment aims to deepen your understanding of a particular aspect of software engineering project management and enhance your skill set as follows:

1. **Strengthen research and problem-solving skills.**
2. **Conduct literature research in software engineering.**
3. **Practice presenting succinct, manager-ready written reports.**
4. **Synthesize lessons learned and best practices into a practical model for future development.**

## Assignment Overview 📝

Choose a topic related to course material (e.g., People, Teams, Processes, Scope, Planning, Controlling) and research it in depth. Your report should be designed for a reader (e.g., a past or future boss, colleague, or MSD student) who is interested in but unfamiliar with the topic. Focus on presenting the current understanding of your chosen topic and, most importantly, on practical applications.

* *Basic* papers serve as literature summaries.
* __Good__ papers synthesize the material and demonstrate its application in improving software development efforts.
* **Excellent** papers offer original, insightful analysis that engages and resonates with readers.

### Additional Guidelines 📝

* Start with an **abstract** summarizing your paper's main points.
* Papers should be approximately **5000-6000 words** (excluding references).
* Format references using the **IEEE style**. Refer to the [guide](https://www.bath.ac.uk/publications/library-guides-to-citing-referencing/attachments/ieee-style-guide.pdf).
* Include **5-10 academic sources** in your bibliography, preferably from IEEE, ACM, or Springer publications.
* Aim to incorporate **1-3 primary sources** (e.g., original research).
* Avoid relying on general web pages as key sources; these will not count toward your bibliography grade.
* Ensure all sources are properly cited and related to your discussion. Familiarity with academic integrity should guide your work.
* **Plagiarism is strictly prohibited** and will be checked.
* The mandatory AI-usage self-declaration must be completed for all papers submitted after 2022. See the [Template](./template.md) for details.

## Grading Criteria (Total: 10 Points) 🏆

* **(2 points)** - **Original Topic**: Demonstrates a focus on synthesis and analysis of a specific area.
* **(2 points)** - **Bibliography**: Includes 5 or more high-quality academic sources.
* **(2 points)** - **Readability**: Clear, well-structured, and coherent writing.
* **(4 points)** - **Content Quality**: See notes above on *Basic*, __Good__, and **Excellent** papers.

Papers receiving a grade of **7 or higher** are eligible for publication.

# Hints and Tips 💡

## Choosing a Topic 🔎

* Select a topic you are passionate about, linked to MSD areas (e.g., people and teams, processes, scope, planning, and controlling).
* Be mindful of your topic's breadth; adjust as needed to find the right balance.
* Use [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) to explore relevant academic papers.
* Ensure there is sufficient material to comprehensively cover your topic.
* Narrow or broaden your focus as necessary for a thorough analysis.
