	title = {Regulatory {Compliance} and its {Impact} on {Software} {Development}},
	abstract = {Abstract. Since the outset of our research, we have been looking for ways to help software companies develop software systems for which regulatory compliance is a key quality attribute. This is because many regulations, laws, standards, and other authoritative rules have a direct impact on the way software systems, used by regulated organizations, are developed, tested, and maintained. In this paper, we particularly discuss the impact of regulatory compliance on software development practices. We achieve this by discussing how regulations and laws impact three main aspects of software which are: product, process, and project. We argue that there is a need for a new field of study that we refer to as software compliance engineering and which aims to investigate techniques and tools for the development and maintenance of auditable software systems.},

	abstract = {This Article identifies a profound, ongoing shift in the modern administrative state: from the regulation of things to the regulation of code. This shift has and will continue to place previously isolated agencies in an increasing state of overlap, raising the likelihood of inconsistent regulations and putting seemingly disparate policy goals, like privacy, safety, environmental protection, and copyright enforcement, in tension. This Article explores this problem through a series of case studies and articulates a taxonomy of code regulations to help place hardware-turned-code rules in context. The Article considers the likely turf wars, regulatory thickets, and related dynamics that are likely to arise, and closes by considering the benefits of creating a new agency with some degree of centralized authority over software regulation issues.},

The concepts described within this paper can be utilized by medical device manufacturers in order to establish a cybersecurity program as part of their quality management systems. In general, there are three complementary ways based on the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) cybersecurity framework that can be used to remove gaps in the organization’s cybersecurity. The first way focuses on designing software products that take cybersecurity into account (i.e., prevention). The second way is to perform security and penetration testing and to apply other cybersecurity controls to reduce attacks and vulnerabilities that could be exploited (i.e., detection). The third way emphasizes maintenance plan in case of a cyberattack (i.e., response and recovery).},

	abstract = {In today's rapidly evolving tech landscape, the principles of DevOps have transcended industry boundaries, bringing transformative changes from FinTech to healthcare. This journey across industries showcases how DevOps practices, originally honed in the fast-paced world of financial technology, are now being adapted to meet the rigorous demands of the healthcare sector. The shift is not just about technology; it's about culture, collaboration, and continuous improvement. In FinTech, where speed, security, and compliance are paramount, DevOps has enabled organizations to innovate quickly while maintaining stringent regulatory standards. As these practices migrate into healthcare, they are reshaping the way hospitals, clinics, and health-tech companies operate, emphasizing patient safety, data privacy, and system reliability. The journey is marked by challenges unique to each field—from the financial sector’s need for rapid deployment and resilience under pressure to healthcare’s focus on compliance with healthcare regulations and ensuring uninterrupted patient care. However, the core principles of DevOps—automation, continuous delivery, and a culture of collaboration—remain consistent, proving that these methodologies can be as effective in improving patient outcomes as they are in driving financial performance. This cross-industry exploration not only highlights the versatility of DevOps but also illustrates the broader impact of this approach, showing how it can drive innovation, improve efficiencies, and foster a culture of continuous improvement across diverse fields. Ultimately, the DevOps journey from FinTech to healthcare is a testament to the adaptability and power of these practices, offering valuable insights for organizations looking to harness the full potential of DevOps, regardless of their industry.},
